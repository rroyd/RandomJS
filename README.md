# JS Projects

I wanted to challenge myself and test my JavaScript skills so I made this repo for practicing my Javascript skills. Feel free to try them out.

# Projects

List of all the projects:

# 1. Coin Gather

A 8-bit styled game where you follow the rules:

The player needs to gather the coin, with 3 lives, each coin gives 1
point.
Each level there is a monster. Every coin you have another monster
is placed.
If a monster reaches you, you get one less life and lose a point.
The goal is to get as many coins as you can.

Coding time: Approx. 24 hours

# 2. Score Keeper

A tool to keep track of each player's score in a ping pong game.

Coding time: 1 hour

# 3. Random Color Picker

Picks a random color and displays it's rgb on the screen and displays the color.

Coding time: 10 minutes

# 4. StopWatch

Simple stopwatch to keep track of how much time has past.

Coding time: 1.5 hours

# 5. Simple To Do List

Simple to do list with a cool UX...

Coding time: 3 hours

# 6. TV Search App

First mini-project to include promises. The application uses the TVMaze API to show TV movies, and has a search engine. The search engine also includes a sorting algorithm (oldest to newest, by date, by rating etc.)

I used the async/await method and Axios to get the data, hence it's the simplest way. I could also use Fetch, or XHR.

Used Hoppstach to analyse the responses, Postman is also a option.
