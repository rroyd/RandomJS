# JS Projects

I wanted to challenge myself and test my JavaScript skills so I made this repo for practicing my Javascript skills. You will also be able to see my JavaScript progression.
Feel free to try them out.

List of all the projects:

# 1. Coin Gather

A 8-bit styled game where you follow the rules:

The player needs to gather the coin, with 3 lives, each coin gives 1
point.
Each level there is a monster. Every coin you have another monster
is placed.
If a monster reaches you, you get one less life and lose a point.
The goal is to get as many coins as you can.

# 5. Simple To Do List

Simple to do list with a cool UX...

Coding time: 3 hours

# 6. TV Search App

First mini-project to include promises. The application uses the TVMaze API to show TV movies, and has a search engine. The search engine also includes a sorting algorithm (oldest to newest, by date, by rating etc.)

I used the async/await method and Axios to get the data, hence it's the simplest way. I could also use Fetch, or XHR.

Used Hoppstach to analyse the responses, Postman is also a option.

# 7. GeoFinder
An app that suggests the client (tourist) places to visit based upon the category he chooses. The application uses the Places Geoapify API for the places and thecompaniesapi for the location.
- Made a live search with a debounce technique. It will fetch results once the client stops searching for 500ms.
- The app has a modern style and a user-friendlty UX.
- Added zoom-in and zoom-out which the API doesn't include.
- Each places consists of a google search and coordinates on the map. The client can center the place on the map.
- Used CSS flexbox and grid to display content responsively with media queries.
- The app is responsive on mobile as well.
- More improvements will come soon.
