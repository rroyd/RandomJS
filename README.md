# JS Projects
I wanted to challenge myself and test my JavaScript skills so I made this repo for practicing my Javascript skills. Feel free to try them out.

# Projects
List of all the projects:

# 1. Coin Gather
A 8-bit styled game where you follow the rules: 

The player needs to gather the coin, with 3 lives, each coin gives 1
            point.
            Each level there is a monster. Every coin you have another monster
            is placed.
            If a monster reaches you, you get one less life and lose a point.
          The goal is to get as many coins as you can.

# 2. Score Keeper
A tool to keep track of each player's score in a ping pong game.

Picks a random color and displays it's rgb on the screen and displays the color.
